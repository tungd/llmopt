# Experiments

* [FX linear smoke](exp-0001-fx-linear.md) - first Python-to-OCaml code-generation probe.
* [LFM2.5 naive MPS execution](exp-0002-lfm25-mps.md) - complete model forward against eager MPS.
* [LFM2.5 MPS ERS benchsuite](exp-0003-lfm25-benchsuite.md) - first scored trace and needle probe.
* [LFM2.5 isolated semantic 5x3 comparison](exp-0004-lfm25-semantic-5x3.md) - long-context raw latency, exact token parity, and ERS dynamic-range observation.
* [Viettel AI Race benchsuite implementation](exp-0005-viettel-racebench-implementation.md) - adopted runner contracts, full trace shape, target adaptation, and the interrupted memory-safe probe.
* [LFM2.5-350M smaller-model probe](exp-0006-lfm25-350m-probe.md) - separate Ninja target for obtaining a memory-safe engine-pass and baseline observation.
* [Q8 weight-only linear lowering](exp-0007-q8-linear-pass.md) - first quantized optimizer and source-emission slice.
* [Generated Q8 Metal runtime](exp-0008-metal-runtime-q8.md) - metallib loading, MPS dispatch, tiled launch correction, and a bounded non-model probe.
